# Minimal Tracking: Sets Per Muscle Group

## Research Foundation

The 2024 meta-analysis of 60+ studies on resistance training dose-response shows that **10-20 sets per muscle group per week, performed close to failure, is optimal for muscle growth.**

## The Problem

Detailed tracking is time-consuming. Some people want accountability but find logging every rep and weight too much. They end up:
- Not tracking at all
- Tracking inconsistently
- Abandoning their routine

Tracking progress is very beneficial for long-term success.

## The Solution

Most tracking methods require logging reps, weight, sets, rest timers, and RPE. That works if you're willing to invest the time. But what if you only tracked one thing: **how many sets close to failure you completed for each muscle group?**

That's what actually matters for muscle growth.

## Simplicity enables consistency.

The best tracking system is the one you actually use. By removing friction, this approach makes it easier to stay consistent, which matters more than perfect data.

## Who This Is For

- People who want structure without complexity
- Those who understand "close to failure" (or are willing to learn)
- Lifters who want a minimalist tracking approach

If you prefer detailed tracking with reps, weights, and RPE, keep doing what works. This is for people who want something simpler
